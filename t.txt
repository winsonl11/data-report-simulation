I created most of the UI and HTML elements of the website. In the scripting, I did the code that determined the best plan for the company, the worst plan, the percentage of the customers who are and are not using the best plan, the average overpayment, and the analysis of the unlimited plan. My partner did the rest of the work, which includes the generation of all the data on the dataset, the calculation of the monthly bills, updating the table on the website to include the dataset, general CSS improvements, and updating the website to include the results of the analyses.

We were not able to include all of the accessibility improvements we talked about last time because we did not use those elements. The three things we put were adding alt tags to images, treating color with care, and using headings to organize a website correctly, but we only included the last two since the website did not have any images.
